Files named "generatingOHgaussianloop", "COgaussianloop", "HIplotsandgauss" are all gaussian loops that only need to be ran once. 
    *** Note "generatingOHgaussianloop" includes generated loop of the plots of baselines too
    Will create folders dedicated to baselines (for OH only) and gaussians (for OH, CO, and HI). 
    Whenever the code needs to be tweaked, delete the plots in the folders created in computer, and rerun the code to avoid possible overlap of data
    All these files include integrals, might be wrong and definitely need to be checked for accuracy.*** 
Files named “...159500-20000**best data” depict gaussians of the line, provide parameters, and my attempt at finding the integrals.
